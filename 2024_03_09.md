Try to use the code in Co-speech-gesture-generation but failed **cuz**

1. The input of the model is in 12 dimension: 3 (x, y z) + 9 (rotation matrix), 18 joints

2. The output is same

3. And the output of the bvh file generated by the inference.py, it convert the 12 dimensions to 6 dimensions which is x,y,z and z rotaion, x rotation and y rotation, here is an example:

   'body_world_Xposition', 'body_world_Yposition', 'body_world_Zposition', 'body_world_Zrotation', 'body_world_Xrotation', 'body_world_Yrotation'

   and then transfer to OFFSET 0.00000 93.20000 0.00000? generate the bvh file



This process is not same...



Another choice is use the code in diffuseStyleGesture.
