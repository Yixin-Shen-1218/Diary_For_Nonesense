Gimbal lock is a term that originates from mechanical engineering but is commonly discussed in the context of 3D computer graphics and aerospace. It refers to a situation where an object with three rotating reference frames (such as a gyroscope or an object in a 3D space being manipulated through rotation) loses one degree of freedom, making it impossible to rotate around one axis due to the alignment of two of the three gimbals (rotating frames).

This phenomenon occurs specifically in the context of representing 3D rotation using Euler angles, where rotation about one axis can cause it to line up with another axis. With Euler angles, rotation is typically represented by three values, each corresponding to a rotation about one of the three orthogonal axes (X, Y, and Z, for instance).

Here’s a basic explanation of how gimbal lock can happen:

1. An object is initially free to rotate in three dimensions, with three separate gimbals that each allow rotation around one axis.
2. The object rotates 90 degrees around one of the gimbals (say, the Y-axis).
3. At this point, a second gimbal (say, the X-axis) becomes aligned with the third gimbal (say, the Z-axis).
4. The object has lost a degree of freedom because now, rotating around the X-axis or the Z-axis would have the same effect—there’s no way to differentiate between these rotations.
5. As a result, it's impossible to orient the object in certain directions just by rotating—it would first have to be rotated away from this locked state.

In aerospace, gimbal lock can be a serious issue for the navigation systems of spacecraft, where maintaining full control over orientation is crucial. In computer graphics, gimbal lock can cause problems when animating rotations, leading to unintended and jarring movements.

To avoid gimbal lock in computer graphics, quaternions are often used instead of Euler angles for representing rotations. Quaternions do not suffer from gimbal lock and provide a smooth, continuous range of rotation in three-dimensional space.
