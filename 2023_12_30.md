Today I studied 

**Coding Stable Diffusion from scratch in PyTorch**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBKpAp_6TGI

as well, like yesterday.



It is to hard to understand,,,TBH,



And I have added the 3d npz to the clip json file.



I want to study how to read the **lmdb** file into program tomorrow.

send a email to the author? Check how to calculate the mean dir?



And tomorrow is the last day of this year, I want to set up my personal website based on github and hangout with my roommate cqc. 



Fighting!
